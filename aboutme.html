            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Ragab, a data specialist and geophysicist based in Montreal, Quebec, I'm passionate about
                problem-solving using diverse data
                sources. I have expertise in acquiring and interpreting data, and recently completed a part-time
                Diploma in Big Data. This equipped me with strong
                skills in data analytics, interpretation, and reporting. I'm proficient in using various business
                intelligence tools to analyze database storage structures, design and create data models, and
                support data-driven decision-making for organizations.</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked on several applied geophysics exploration projects to support geotechnical, structural,
                pavement, bridge deck, utility, and archeological investigations
                These projects were carried out by the following techniques: Electrical Resistivity Tomography ERT,
                induced polarization, self-potential SP, Ground Penetrating
                Radar (GPR), surface waves (MASW and ultrasonic), reflection seismic, refraction seismic, echo sounding,
                and sidescan sonar.
